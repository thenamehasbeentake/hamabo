Device:
        This column gives the device (or partition) name as listed in the /dev directory.

tps
        Indicate the number of transfers per second that were issued to the device. A transfer is an I/O request
        to  the  device.  Multiple  logical  requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the device. A
        transfer is of indeterminate size.
    指示发送到设备的每秒传输次数。 传输是对设备的 I/O 请求。 多个逻辑请求可以合并为一个对设备的 I/O 请求。 传输的大小不确定。
Blk_read/s (kB_read/s, MB_read/s)
        Indicate the amount of data read from the device expressed in a number of blocks (kilobytes,  megabytes)
        per second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors and therefore have a size of 512 bytes.
        指示从设备读取的数据量，以每秒块数（千字节、兆字节）表示。 块相当于扇区，因此大小为 512 字节

Blk_wrtn/s (kB_wrtn/s, MB_wrtn/s)
        Indicate the amount of data written to the device expressed in a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes)
        per second.
        指示写入设备的数据量，以每秒块数（千字节、兆字节）表示。
Blk_read (kB_read, MB_read)
        The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) read.

Blk_wrtn (kB_wrtn, MB_wrtn)
        The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) written.

rrqm/s
        The number of read requests merged per second that were queued to the device.
        从队列到设备的每秒合并的读取请求数。
wrqm/s
        The number of write requests merged per second that were queued to the device.
        排队到设备的每秒合并的写入请求数。
r/s
        The number (after merges) of read requests completed per second for the device.
        设备每秒完成的读取请求数（合并后）。
w/s
        The number (after merges) of write requests completed per second for the device.

rsec/s (rkB/s, rMB/s)
        The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) read from the device per second.
        每秒从设备读取的扇区数（千字节、兆字节）。
wsec/s (wkB/s, wMB/s)
        The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) written to the device per second.

avgrq-sz
        The average size (in sectors) of the requests that were issued to the device.
        向设备发出的请求的平均大小（以扇区为单位）
        差不多是 (rkB/s  +  wkB/s) / (r/s  +   w/s ) *  2  单位sector
avgqu-sz
        The average queue length of the requests that were issued to the device.
        向设备发出的请求的平均队列长度。
await
        The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the
        time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.
        向要提供服务的设备发出的 I/O 请求的平均时间（以毫秒为单位）。 这包括队列中请求所花费的时间以及为它们提供服务所花费的时间
r_await
        The  average  time  (in milliseconds) for read requests issued to the device to be served. This includes
        the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

w_await
        The average time (in milliseconds) for write requests issued to the device to be served.  This  includes
        the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

svctm
        The  average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests that were issued to the device. Warning! Do
        not trust this field any more.  This field will be removed in a future sysstat version.

%util
        Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued to the  device  (bandwidth  utilization
        for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100%.
